# C02
My second C project

This was my second C project coded on my centOS8 Oracle virtual machine. This code was meant to
input a text file given to me by my professor and which included a ton of coordinates and return
a text file in the formatting given to me by my professor. I also needed to calculate the distance
between each coordinate in both seconds, and with normal circumstances. I ran multiple tests through
a GNU debugger, gdb. I went through each line of code and made sure each ran properly. I then ran my
code against a text file file to get an output and ran a driver to test my text output to the given
output my professor gave me and found a 100% success rate with any given coordinates.
